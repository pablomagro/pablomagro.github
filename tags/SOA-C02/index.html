In this case, you can create a CloudWatch alarm that monitors the CPU utilization metric of the EC2 instance. When the CPU utilization reaches 100%, the alarm will be triggered, and you can configure actions such as sending notifications or executing automated actions to address the unresponsiveness issue.</p>

Set the alarm action to <code>recover the EC2 instance</code>. Configure the alarm notification to be published to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic.</h3><p><code>Explanation</code>: By creating a <code>CloudWatch alarm</code> for Status <code>Check Failed: System</code>, you can<code> automate the recovery task of EC2 instances</code> (<code>stop, terminate, reboot, or recover your Amazon EC2 instances</code>). When the system health check fails for an EC2 instance, the alarm will be triggered and perform the configured action to recover the instance. This eliminates the need for manual intervention. Additionally, configuring the alarm to publish notifications to an SNS topic allows you to receive notifications whenever a system health check fails.</p>

<h4 id="EBS-Snapshots"><a href="#EBS-Snapshots" class="headerlink" title="EBS Snapshots"></a>EBS Snapshots</h4><p>It is possible to <code>create an automated snapshot of an existing Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)</code> volume on a schedule. You can choose a fixed rate to create a snapshot every few minutes or use a cron expression to specify that the snapshot is made at a specific time of day.</p>
<p>Snapshots are incremental backups, which means that only the blocks on the device that have changed after your most recent snapshot are saved. This minimizes the time required to create the snapshot and saves on storage costs by not duplicating data. Each snapshot contains all of the information that is needed to restore your data (from the moment when the snapshot was taken) to a new EBS volume.</p>

<h3 id="CloudWatch-Synthetics"><a href="#CloudWatch-Synthetics" class="headerlink" title="CloudWatch Synthetics"></a>CloudWatch Synthetics</h3><p>CloudWatch Synthetics canaries are automated scripts that monitor the availability and performance of applications, endpoints, and APIs. They are <code>designed to simulate user interactions with an application and provide insights into its behavior</code>.</p>
<p>Canaries are created using scripts written in Node.js or Python and are scheduled to run at regular intervals. These scripts perform tasks such as navigating through a website, clicking on specific elements, submitting forms, and validating responses. By executing these predefined actions, canaries can monitor the functionality, responsiveness, and performance of an application or API.</p>
<p>CloudWatch Synthetics canaries collect data on metrics like response time, latency, availability, and success rates. They can also be configured to generate alarms when certain conditions are met, allowing proactive identification and remediation of issues.</p>

You can view statistical graphs of your published metrics with the AWS Management Console. CloudWatch stores data about a metric as a series of data points. Each data point has an associated time stamp. You can even publish an aggregated set of data points called a statistic set.</p>
<p>The <code>put-metric-data</code> <code>command</code> publishes metric data to Amazon CloudWatch, which associates it with the specified metric. If the specified metric does not exist, CloudWatch creates the metric which can take up to fifteen minutes for the metric to appear in calls to <code>ListMetrics</code>.</p>

<p><code>Explanation</code>: Enabling <code>CloudTrail log file integrity validation</code> ensures that the log files are protected against tampering or unauthorized modification. CloudTrail uses SHA-256 hashes to validate the integrity of the log files stored in Amazon S3. By enabling this feature, the SysOps administrators can easily verify the integrity of the log files and ensure that they have not been deleted or changed.</p>

<h2 id="👀-Q-AWS-Config"><a href="#👀-Q-AWS-Config" class="headerlink" title="👀 *Q AWS Config"></a>👀 <code>*Q</code> AWS Config</h2><p>AWS Config <code>keeps track of</code> the <code>configuration</code> of <code>your AWS resources and their relationships to other resources</code>. It can also <code>evaluate</code> those AWS <code>resources for compliance</code>. This service uses rules that can be configured to evaluate AWS resources against desired configurations.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>can track <code>changes</code> to <em><code>CloudFormation stacks</code></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>AWS Config can track changes to CloudFormation stacks. A CloudFormation stack is a collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit. With AWS Config, you can review the historical configuration of your CloudFormation stacks and review all changes that occurred to them.</p>
<p>For more information about how AWS Config can track changes to CloudFormation deployments, see <code>cloudformation-stack-drift-detection-check</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>there are AWS Config <code>rules</code> that <code>check</code> whether or not your <em><code>Amazon S3 buckets have logging enabled</code></em> or your <code>IAM users have an MFA device enabled</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>AWS Config provides a number of AWS managed rules that address a wide range of security concerns such as checking if you <code>encrypted</code> your Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes, tagged your resources appropriately, and enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA) for root accounts.</p>
<p>👀 AWS Config is a service that <code>enables</code> you to <code>assess</code>, <code>audit</code>, and <code>evaluate</code> the <code>configurations</code> of your <code>AWS resources</code>. It provides detailed <code>inventory</code> and <code>configuration</code> history of your resources, as well as configuration change notifications. With AWS Config, you can track the configuration of your S3 bucket, including its bucket policy.</p>
<p>AWS Config rules use AWS Lambda functions to perform the compliance evaluations, and the Lambda functions return the compliance status of the evaluated resources as compliant or noncompliant. The non-compliant resources are remediated using the remediation action associated with the AWS Config rule. With the Auto-Remediation feature of AWS Config rules, the remediation action can be executed automatically when a resource is found non-compliant.</p>
<p><code>AWS Config Auto Remediation feature</code> has auto remediate feature for any non-compliant S3 buckets using the following AWS Config rules:
s3-bucket-logging-enabled s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited
These AWS Config rules act as controls to prevent any non-compliant S3 activities.</p>

<p>Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps you <code>test</code> the <code>network accessibility</code> of your Amazon EC2 instances and the <code>security state of your applications running on the instances</code>.</p>
<p>An Amazon Inspector assessment report can be generated for an assessment run once it has been successfully completed. An assessment report is a document that details what is tested in the assessment run, and the results of the assessment. The results of your assessment are formatted into a standard report, which can be generated to share results within your team for remediation actions, to enrich compliance audit data, or to store for future reference.</p>
<p>You can select from two types of report for your assessment, a findings report or a full report. The findings report contains an executive summary of the assessment, the instances targeted, the rules packages tested, the rules that generated findings, and detailed information about each of these rules along with the list of instances that failed the check. The full report contains all the
information in the findings report and additionally provides the list of rules that were checked and passed on all instances in the assessment target.</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Increase</code> the <code>size of the nodes</code> in the cluster: This allows for more available memory in each node, reducing the likelihood of evictions due to limited cache space.</li>
<li><code>Increase</code> the <code>number of nodes</code> in the cluster: By adding more nodes, the overall cache capacity increases, reducing the chance of evictions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/mem-ug/CacheMetrics.WhichShouldIMonitor.html#metrics-evictions">Evictions metric</a> for Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached represents the number of nonexpired items that the cache evicted to provide space for new items. If you are experiencing evictions with your cluster, it is usually a sign that you need to scale up (use a node that has a larger memory footprint)
or scale out (add additional nodes to the cluster) to accommodate the additional data</p>
<h2 id="VPC"><a href="#VPC" class="headerlink" title="VPC"></a><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/how-it-works.html#what-is-privatelink">VPC</a></h2><p>With Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you can launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you’ve defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you’d operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.</p>
<p><code>enableDnsHostnames</code> – Indicates whether the instances launched in the VPC get public DNS hostnames. If this attribute is true, instances in the VPC get public DNS hostnames, but only <code>if</code> the <code>enableDnsSupport</code> attribute is also set to <code>true</code>.</p>
<p><code>enableDnsSupport</code> – Indicates whether the DNS resolution is supported for the VPC. If this attribute is false, the Amazon-provided DNS server in the VPC that resolves public DNS hostnames to IP addresses is not enabled. If this attribute is true, queries to the Amazon provided DNS server at the 169.254.169.253 IP address, or the reserved IP address at the base of the VPC IPv4 network range plus two will succeed.</p>
<p>By default, both attributes are set to <code>true</code> in a default VPC or a VPC created by the VPC wizard. By default, only the <code>enableDnsSupport</code> attribute is set to true in a VPC created on the Your VPCs page of the VPC console or using the AWS CLI, API, or an AWS SDK.</p>
<h3 id="Configuration"><a href="#Configuration" class="headerlink" title="Configuration"></a>Configuration</h3><p><code>Regardless of the type of subnet, the internal IPv4 address range of the subnet is always private</code>. AWS never announces these address blocks to the internet.</p>
<p><code>When you create a VPC, you must specify a range of IPv4 addresses for the VPC</code> in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block; for example, 10.0.0.0&#x2F;16. This is the primary CIDR block for your VPC.</p>
<p><code>Subnets created in a VPC can communicate with each other</code>, this is default behaviour. The main route table facilitates this communication.</p>

The NAT gateway acts as a bridge between the private subnet and the internet, allowing the Lambda function to securely access external resources.</p>
<h3 id="VPC-Endpoint"><a href="#VPC-Endpoint" class="headerlink" title="VPC Endpoint"></a>VPC Endpoint</h3><p>A VPC Endpoint allows you to <code>connect</code> your <code>VPC</code> directly <code>to AWS services</code> without the need for <code>internet gateways</code>, <code>NAT gateways</code>, or <code>VPN connections</code>. It enables private communication between your VPC and the AWS service without going over the internet.</p>
<p>To configure a VPC Endpoint for accessing AWS Systems Manager APIs, you can follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a VPC Endpoint for AWS Systems Manager in your Amazon VPC. This creates an elastic network interface with a private IP address within your VPC.</li>
<li>Update the route tables in your VPC to route traffic destined for the AWS Systems Manager API endpoints to the VPC Endpoint. This ensures that traffic is directed through the VPC Endpoint instead of going over the internet.</li>
<li>Verify that your on-premises instances and AWS managed instances are configured to use the appropriate VPC and route tables.</li>

<p><code>Explanation</code>: When mounting an Amazon EFS file system from EC2 instances, the security group associated with the mount target should allow inbound NFS (Network File System) connections from the security group used by the EC2 instances. By default, the security group associated with the mount target allows inbound connections from the default security group of the VPC. If the EC2 instances are using a different security group, it needs to be added to the mount target’s security group’s inbound rules to allow NFS connections.</p>

<p><code>Explanation</code>: AWS Backup provides a centralized and automated solution for backing up data. By creating a backup plan and assigning resources by resource ID, you can easily include all existing EC2 instances and EFS file systems in the backup process.

Amazon EC2 deletes the Amazon EBS volume that has the <code>DeleteOnTermination</code> attribute set to true, but it does not publish the <code>DeleteVolume</code> API call. This is because AWS Config uses the DeleteVolume API call as a trigger with the rule, and the resource changes aren’t recorded for the EBS volume.

<li>The possibility to resize an instance depends on whether the root device is an EBS volume. If it is, you can easily change the instance size by modifying its instance type, also known as resizing. However, if the root device is an instance store volume, you need to migrate your application to a new instance with the desired instance type.</li>
<li>Before changing the instance type of your Amazon EBS-backed instance, you must stop it. AWS will then move the instance to new hardware, but the instance ID will remain the same.</li>
<li>If your instance belongs to an Auto Scaling group, the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service considers the stopped instance as unhealthy and may terminate it, launching a replacement instance instead. To avoid this, you can temporarily suspend the scaling processes for the group while resizing your instance.</li>

<p>You can assign a retention period to an object version either explicitly or through a default setting at the bucket level.

<h3 id="IAM-Policy-Types"><a href="#IAM-Policy-Types" class="headerlink" title="IAM Policy Types"></a>IAM Policy Types</h3><p>You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource such as an Amazon S3 bucket. These policies grant the specified principal permission to perform specific actions on that resource and define under what conditions this applies.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Identity-based</code> policies are attached to an IAM user, group, or role. These policies let you specify what that identity can do (its permissions).</li>
<li><code>Resource-based</code> policies are attached to a resource. For example, you can attach resource-based policies to Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon SQS queues, and AWS Key Management Service encryption keys.</li>
<li><code>Identity-based</code> policies and <code>resource-based</code> policies are both permissions policies and are evaluated together. For a request to which only permissions policies apply, AWS first checks all policies for a Deny. If one exists, then the request is denied. Then AWS checks for each Allow. If at least one policy statement allows the action in the request, the request is allowed. It doesn’t matter whether the Allow is in the identity-based policy or the resource-based policy.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Trust-policy"><a href="#Trust-policy" class="headerlink" title="Trust policy"></a>Trust policy</h4><p>Defines which principal entities (accounts, users, roles, and federated users) can assume the role. An IAM role is both an identity and a resource that supports resource-based policies. For this reason, you <code>must attach both a trust policy and an identity-based policy to an IAM role</code>. The <code>IAM service</code> <code>supports only one</code> type of <code>resource-based</code> policy called a <code>role trust policy</code>, which is attached to an IAM role.</p>

<ol>
<li>AMIs are regional resources and can be shared across Regions: AMIs are specific to a particular AWS Region. If you want to use an AMI in a different Region, you need to copy the AMI to that Region. Sharing an AMI across Regions requires creating a new copy in each desired Region.
2&#x2F; You need to share any CMKs used to encrypt snapshots and any Amazon EBS snapshots that the AMI references: If the AMI references Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) snapshots, you must also share those snapshots. Additionally, if the snapshots are encrypted using customer-managed customer master keys (CMKs), you need to share the CMKs as well.</li>

<h2 id="AWS-Storage-Gateway"><a href="#AWS-Storage-Gateway" class="headerlink" title="AWS Storage Gateway"></a>AWS Storage Gateway</h2><p>AWS Storage Gateway is a set of hybrid cloud storage services that provide on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage.</p>
<p>AWS Storage Gateway <code>uses SSL/TLS</code> (Secure Socket Layers&#x2F;Transport Layer Security) <code>to encrypt data</code> that is transferred <code>between your gateway appliance and AWS storage</code>. By default, Storage Gateway uses Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys (SSE-S3) to server-side encrypt all data it stores in Amazon S3. You have an option to use the Storage Gateway API to configure your gateway to encrypt data stored in the cloud using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) customer master keys (CMKs).</p>
<p>File, Volume and Tape Gateway data is stored in Amazon S3 buckets by AWS Storage Gateway. Tape Gateway supports backing data to Amazon S3 Glacier apart from the standard storage.</p>
<p>Encrypting a file share: For a file share, you can configure your gateway to encrypt your objects with AWS KMS–managed keys by using SSE-KMS.</p>
<p>Encrypting a volume: For cached and stored volumes, you can configure your gateway to encrypt volume data stored in the cloud with AWS KMS–managed keys by using the Storage Gateway API.</p>
<p>Encrypting a tape: For a virtual tape, you can configure your gateway to encrypt tape data stored in the cloud with AWS KMS–managed keys by using the Storage Gateway API.</p>
<h3 id="Tape-Gateway"><a href="#Tape-Gateway" class="headerlink" title="Tape Gateway"></a>Tape Gateway</h3><p>Tape Gateway enables you to replace using physical tapes on-premises with virtual tapes in AWS without changing existing backup workflows. Tape Gateway supports all leading backup applications and caches virtual tapes on-premises for low-latency data access. Tape Gateway encrypts data between the gateway and AWS for secure data transfer and compresses data and transitions virtual tapes between Amazon S3 and Amazon S3 Glacier, or Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive, to minimize storage costs.</p>
<h3 id="File-Gateway"><a href="#File-Gateway" class="headerlink" title="File Gateway"></a>File Gateway</h3><p>File Gateway provides a seamless way to connect to the cloud in order to store application data files and backup images as durable objects in Amazon S3 cloud storage.

You can share in several ways, including <code>account-to-account</code> sharing, <code>organizational</code> sharing, and <code>deploying catalogs using stack sets</code>.</p>
<p>Before you share your products and portfolios to other accounts, you must decide whether you want to share a reference of the catalog or to deploy a copy of the catalog into each recipient account. Note that if you deploy a copy, you must redeploy if there are updates you want to propagate to the recipient accounts.</p>
<p>You can use stack sets to deploy your catalog to many accounts at the same time. If you want to share a reference (an imported version of your portfolio that stays in sync with the original), you can use account-to-account sharing or you can share using AWS Organizations.</p>

<li>Use the <code>elasticfilesystem:Encrypted</code> IAM condition key in AWS IAM identity-based policies to mandate users for creating only encrypted-at-rest Amazon EFS file systems</li>
</ul>
<p>You can create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policy to control whether users can create Amazon EFS file systems that are encrypted at rest. The Boolean condition key elasticfilesystem:Encrypted specifies the type of file system, encrypted or unencrypted, that the policy applies to. You use the condition key with the elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem action and the policy effect, allow or deny, to create a policy for creating encrypted or unencrypted file systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Define <code>Service Control Policies (SCPs)</code> inside <code>AWS Organizations</code> to enforce EFS encryption for all AWS accounts in your organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Service control policies (SCPs) are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization.</p>
<p>An SCP restricts permissions for IAM users and roles in member accounts, including the member account’s root user. If a user or role has an IAM permission policy that grants access to an action that is either not allowed or explicitly denied by the applicable SCPs, the user or role can’t perform that action. You can also define service control policies (SCPs) inside AWS Organizations to enforce EFS encryption for all AWS accounts in your organization.</p>

<li><code>Health checks that monitor an endpoint</code> – You can configure a health check that monitors an endpoint that you specify either by IP address or by domain name. At regular intervals that you specify, Route 53 submits automated requests over the internet to your application, server, or other resources to verify that it’s reachable, available, and functional. Optionally, you can configure the health check to make requests similar to those that your users make, such as requesting a web page from a specific URL.</li>
<li><code>Health checks that monitor other health checks</code> (calculated health checks) – You can create a health check that monitors whether Route 53 considers other health checks healthy or unhealthy. One situation where this might be useful is when you have multiple resources that perform the same function, such as multiple web servers, and your chief concern is whether some minimum number of your resources are healthy. You can create a  health check for each resource without configuring notifications for those health checks. Then you can create a health check that monitors the status of the other health checks, and that notifies you only when the number of available web resources drops below a specified threshold.</li>
<li><code>Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms</code> – You can create CloudWatch alarms that monitor the status of CloudWatch metrics, such as the number of throttled read events for an Amazon DynamoDB database or the number of Elastic Load Balancing hosts that are considered healthy. After you create an alarm, you can create a health check that monitors the same data stream that CloudWatch monitors for the alarm.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="“Evaluate-Target-Health”"><a href="#“Evaluate-Target-Health”" class="headerlink" title="“Evaluate Target Health”"></a>“Evaluate Target Health”</h3><p>You need to set the “Evaluate Target Health” <code>flag</code> to <code>true</code> on Route 53.

This lets you identify unintended access to your resources and data, which is a security risk. Access Analyzer identifies resources shared with external principals by using logic-based reasoning to analyze the resource-based policies in your AWS environment. For each instance of a resource shared outside of your account, Access Analyzer generates a finding.</p>
<h2 id="👀"><a href="#👀" class="headerlink" title="👀"></a>👀</h2><p>You can allow IAM users or roles in one AWS account to use a customer master key (CMK) in a different AWS account. You can add these permissions when you create the CMK or change the permissions for an existing CMK.</p>
<p><code>To permit the usage of a CMK to users and roles in another account, you must use two different types of policies</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>The key policy for the CMK must give the external account (or users and roles in the external account) permission to use the CMK. The key policy is in the account that owns the CMK.</li>
<li>IAM policies in the external account must delegate the key policy permissions to its users and roles. These policies are set in the external account and give permissions to users and roles in that account.</li>
</ol>
<p>The cfn-signal helper script signals AWS CloudFormation to indicate whether Amazon EC2 instances have been successfully created or updated. If you install and configure software applications on instances, you can signal AWS CloudFormation when those software applications are ready.</p>
<p>You use the cfn-signal script in conjunction with a CreationPolicy or an Auto Scaling group with a WaitOnResourceSignals update policy. When AWS CloudFormation creates or updates resources with those policies, it suspends work on the stack until the resource receives the requisite number of signals or until the timeout period is exceeded. For each valid signal that AWS CloudFormation receives, AWS CloudFormation publishes the signals to the stack events so that you track each signal.</p>
